# Predicting taxi trips

#### Task: 
- Train a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.

#### Description:
- Historical data on taxi orders at airports are analyzed. The number of taxi orders for the next hour is predicted to attract more drivers during peak periods. A model is built for such a prediction. The value of the RMSE metric on the test sample must be less than 48.
