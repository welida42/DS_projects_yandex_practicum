#### Task: 
- Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze customer behavior and find the optimal tariff

- The mobile operator found out: many customers use archived rates. A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs for a sample of customers was carried out, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services was analyzed and the optimal sets of services for users were recommended. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions are tested. A profitable tariff plan has been identified for adjusting the advertising budget. A system has been developed that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff. A model has been built for the classification problem, which will select a suitable tariff. A model was built with the highest possible accuracy. The share of correct answers has been brought to 0.75. Accuracy was checked on the test sample.
