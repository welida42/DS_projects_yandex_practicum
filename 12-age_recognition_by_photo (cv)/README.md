# Age recognition by photo

#### Task: 
- Build a machine learning model that determines the approximate age of a person from a photo. There is a set of photos of people with an indication of their age.

#### Description:
- A supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo-fixing in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
  - Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to shoppers of that age group;
  - Control the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.

A model was built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. 
Analyzed a set of photos of people with an indication of age using computer vision using off-the-shelf neural networks and the Keras library.
