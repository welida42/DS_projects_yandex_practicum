# Development of new oil fields

#### Task: 
- Decide in which region to extract oil. Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

#### Description:
- The production company GlavRosGosNeft needs to decide where to drill a new well. Collected characteristics of oil sample for wells: oil quality and volume of its reserves in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. A model has been built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells. Wells with the highest estimated values were selected. The regions with the maximum total profit of the selected wells have been identified. A model has been built to determine the region where production will bring the greatest profit. Potential profits and risks were analyzed using Bootstrap technique.

#### Used Libraries:
- Pandas, sklearn, math, numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Bootstrap, Machine Learning
